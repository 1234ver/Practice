## Description of Github files
### Running a python module to get the merged dataframe output 
**Merge Output**

To get the merge output from my THA1, first go to the "Practice" folder on my Github page. Once within the practice folder, click on the file "Copy_of_THA1_data_merge.ipynb". From there, click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the page. Once the file is open in Colab, you can click "Run all" to merge my three datasets, "2017apps_dataset3.xlsx", "2017inadm_dataset2.xlsx", and "Field office overview_dataset1.xlsx". You will find a lengthier description of the information that these datasets contain within the Colab file. 

**Additional Github files**

In addition to "Copy_of_THA1_data_merge.ipynb", I have uploaded the files that I merged in THA1, "2017apps_dataset3.xlsx", "2017inadm_dataset2.xlsx", and "Field office overview_dataset1.xlsx".  

I have also uploaded several new files, which I plan to use in the future for my project. These files contain survey information from the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF) for the years 2013-2017. They are called "2017colef.xlsx", "2016colef.xlsx", and so on until 2013. 

The "Practice" folder also contains several .pdf files which I plan to use for my future project.

**Potential Project and Research Questions**

My research project will examine the impact of the Trump administration's asylum metering policy on organized crime along the US-Mexico border. Prior to 2017, migrants fleeing their home countries could approach US ports of entry from Mexico (i.e., bridges) to ask for asylum. The administration's new metering policy forces asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico for a period of several weeks or months before they can even approach US ports of entry to ask for asylum. It is well established that this metering policy has caused the number of unauthorized border crossings -- in other words, crossings between ports of entry -- to rise. Typically, migrants crossing pay organized criminal groups to help them cross between ports of entry. 

My question is: have metering and other forms of security, such as border walls, caused the price of unauthorized crossings to rise -- are migrants paying more money to organized criminal groups as a result of this policy? This project will also look at crime indicators in US-Mexico border cities to see if metering has caused (or coincided with) an increase in organized crime.
