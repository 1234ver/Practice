## Description of Github files
### Running a python module to get the merged dataframe output 
**Merge Output**

In order to get the merge output from my THA1, first go to the "Practice" folder on my Github page. Once within the practice folder, click on the file "Copy_of_THA1_data_merge.ipynb". From there, click on the "Open in Colab" button at the top of the page. Once the file is open in Colab, you can click "Run all" to merge my three datasets, "2017apps_dataset3.xlsx", "2017inadm_dataset2.xlsx", and "Field office overview_dataset1.xlsx". You will find a lengthier description of the information that these datasets contain within the Colab file. 

**Additional Github files**

In addition to "Copy_of_THA1_data_merge.ipynb", I have uploaded the files "2017apps_dataset3.xlsx", "2017inadm_dataset2.xlsx", and "Field office overview_dataset1.xlsx" I have also uploaded several new files, which I plan to use in the future for my project. These files contain survey information from the Colegio de la Frontera Norte (COLEF) for the years 2013-2017. They are called "2017colef.xlsx", "2016colef.xlsx", and so on until 2013. 

The "Practice" folder also contains several .pdf files which I also plan to use for my future project.
